## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  Variables act as containers for storing data values.
- How do you **declare** a variable?
  Using var, let, or const.
- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  using = symbol
- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  characters can include letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, but must start with a letter, $, or \_.
- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  Capitalization matters, two variables with the same name are treated as 2 separate variables due to different capitalization.
- What is the purpose of a string?
  A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.
- What is the purpose of a number?
  Numbers are used to represent both integer and floating-point value.
- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  Booleans represent one of two values: true or false. They are typically used in conditional testing where you need to decide which path of code to execute based on the truthiness of a condition.
- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.
- How do you update the value of a variable?
  Use let when the value of the variable is expected to change.
- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
  Undefined is assigned to variables that have been declared but not initialized with a value, it represents the absence of value or not defined. Value null is intentionally used to represent no value or empty value and it must be assigned explicitly to a variable and null is an object.
- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?
  Labels help readers to not get confused and labels allow us to see which variables are being logged and in what order.
- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  strings, booleans, numbers, undefined, and null.
