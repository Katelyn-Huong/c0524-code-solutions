## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  block of code that can be defined and then called on later at point in time.
- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  function keyword to begin a creation of a new function, optional name, comma separated list of 0 or more parameters, surrounded by parenthesis. opening curly brace for start of function's code block, optional return statement and closing curly brace at the end of function code's block.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  function's name, comma separated list of zero or more arguments surrounded by ()
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  no function key words in call. the definition allows us to call the function whenever is needed.
- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  parameters are placeholders, the value of is not known until we call the function and pass an argument. An argument will be called when the code block is run. arguments are passed to function.
- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  allows you to make functions to take different values.
- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  A return statement causes the function to produce a value.
  A return statement also exits the function; no code after the return statement is executed.
- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  no function name, parameters, => code block return
- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  return value on the same line.
