## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a **breakpoint** in responsive Web design?
  breakpoints allow the layout to change at predefined points. specific values at which a website's content and design will adapt in a certain way in order to provide the best possible user experience on different screen sizes.
- What is the advantage of using a percentage (_e.g._ `50%`) width instead of a fixed (_e.g._ `px`) width for a "column" class in a responsive layout?
  pixel density can vary so we need units that are flexible and work everywhere percents allow us to do that.
- If you introduce CSS rules for a smaller `min-width` _after_ the styles for a larger `min-width` in your style sheet, the CSS rules for the **smaller** `min-width` will "win". Why is that?
  due to the cascading nature of CSS, it appear later in the stylesheet.
